          I WANT TO COURT YOU 
        </p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>I really wanted to say that when we first met, that's the reason why i brought you sa park, i was gonna confess to u but sitting there with you by my side, your head on my shoulder while we were bantering, the moment just overwhelemed me.</p>
          <br>
           <p>Anywaysss... the point is, my intentions never faded, im gonna pursue you whatever it takes. I know i might not be the most handsome or smartest boy you have ever met, and even though i'm older, i still act like a childish kid sometimes and i'm socially awkward, but i would be your biggest supporter, loyal, love you with my whole heart, and be the boy who will be there for you no matter what. 
            </p>
        <br>

        <p>Let me love you with all my heart. Let me give you the love you deserve. I want to pursue you but please don't give up on me when the times get though. 
</p>
<br>
        <p>And to be honest, i don't know how to properly court someone, that's why i'm not gonna rush it, that's why i really want to know you more. I want to peel back the layers, understand you more, your dreams, your fears, what makes yanah, yanah. And i want to open my life to you too, completely, like i said earlier i don't care how long it takes because the truth is simple:
        </p>

        I love and appreciate you so muchhh :3 ü§ç
