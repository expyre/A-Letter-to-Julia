        <h1>To my dearest Julia Samson</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="subtitle">
          I APPRECIATE YOU FOR BEING MY GIRLFRIEND 
        </p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Words truly can't emphasize how much I appreciate and love you. Every single day, you make me feel so deeply loved, and I want to give that love back to you ten times over. It's the most incredible feeling, being loved the way I am by you, and I find myself so incredibly in love and obsessed with you.</p>
          <br>
           <p>Looking back on our time together, so much has happened. We've laughed, we've teased, we've flirted, we've argued, and we've cried. And I love all of it, baby, because that is what a real, healthy relationship is raw, messy, and beautifully human. I want to do it all, as long as it's with you. Let's continue to help each other grow and learn from our mistakes, so we can better ourselves and mature together.
            </p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for everything you've given me, Julia. You've shown me your soul, and I saw nothing but kindness and purity. The love you give is so genuine, and I really want to show you my soul, too. I want to give you everything, because you deserve it all from me.
</p>
<br>
        <p>You are the best thing that has ever come into my life. You make me realize there is still hope in this world, and you've made me stronger. You are the one I lean on through all my problems. I don't want to let you go, ever. I don't know what I would do without your presence; it would drive me crazy. With you I want to grow, learn from our mistakes, and become better people together. The raw, messy parts of us, the teasing, the fights, the laughter, the silly moments, are all beautiful because they're ours. Please, be with me forever, because I will fight for our love forever. I am yours, and only yours, for life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am so in love with you, and I keep falling for you more each day. It feels so good to love you. I love everything about us, the way we can make love for hours, laugh together, get happy, have deep talks about our future, and even the way we argue and then fix things together immediately. It all feels so pure and genuine. We really do love each other, don't we?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          That's why I never want to lose you. No matter what happens, it will always be you and me. I will always find my way back to you, because I will do anything and everything for us to be together again and again. I fucking love you forever, and I mean it. I genuinely want to marry you so badly in the future. I want you to be my husband and the father of our future kids. You are my wife in my heart already. Thank you for being the best girlfriend and wife I could ever ask for.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          You are the best thing that came into my life. You make me want to keep living, keep fighting, keep loving. You deserve everything I have to give, and I can't wait to share more of my soul with you. Please stay with me forever. I will fight for our love always. I love you so much, my very own Julia Gelindon. I will keep loving you every single day, and I will never, ever get tired of it, okay?
        </p>
        <p class="closing">
        Here's to more months, years, and decades together. I love you forever and ever.  
        </p>
        <p class="signature">From your one and only boyfriend, <br>Justine Gelindon</p>
